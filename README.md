# web-bluetooth
Connect to my Roland FP-30 Piano through bluetooth w/ nothing but javascript.

- Unfortunately, only works w/ USB.  I can successfully pair with bluetooth, but Web Midi does not detect the device unless connected via USB.
- Once connected, it can detect keyboard input and display the note and octave pressed.
